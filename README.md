# Simple Terminal-like Online Portofolio

A simple online portofolio made using reactJs. It's design is inspired by Fallout games terminal where the player navigate the terminal not by using keyboard command but using mouse(PC) or gamepad(Console).This is implementation is rather simple and can be iterated further.

Feel free to fork this project and explore many ideas :)
